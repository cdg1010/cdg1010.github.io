# Importing Reflect data to the Editor

To see the contents of your Reflect folder in the Editor, go to **Window** > **Reflect**.

The Reflect window displays the current project by default. To see all your projects, select *Show All Projects.*

<img src="../images/EditorShowProjects.png" style="width: 275px; padding: 10px; margin: 0 0 10px 0">

The Projects window does not automatically refresh. If you create a new project while the window is open, click **Refresh** to see it.

To see any changes from a synced application (such as Revit), click **Update** while editing a model in the prefab. Your model is imported to a newly created Reflect folder, inside a folder named after your project. Drag the prefab named after your project into an empty scene.
