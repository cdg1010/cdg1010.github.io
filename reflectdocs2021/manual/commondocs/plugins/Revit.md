# The Reflect plugin for Revit

The Reflect plugin is available for the following versions of Revit:

* 2018*
* 2019
* 2020
* 2021

*Revit 2018 is still supported but is not maintained due to Autodeskâ€™s policy of supporting only the most recent three versions.*

## Installation

To install the plugin, run the [Reflect installer](../ReflectInstaller.md) and select your version or versions of Revit.

Once the Revit plugin is installed on your computer, you can start the Reflect service from inside Revit to begin real-time syncing.

<!---**Create a Unity Project to sync with Reflect**

The beta version of Reflect requires you to create a Project from the Hub. Future versions  will allow you to create projects within Reflect.

1. Open the Unity Hub.
2. Click **Projects** and then click the drop-down arrow next to **New**.
3. Select version 2019.x (or later) and create your Project.--->

## Syncing

To start syncing Revit data with the Unity Editor:

1. Open Revit. If prompted to grant permissions to the Unity plugin, select **Load Once** (or **Always Load** to avoid future prompts).

2. Open the Revit project you want to sync with Reflect. If the Reflect plugin is installed, the ribbon includes a **Unity** tab:

   ![RevitUnityTab](../images/RevitUnityTab.png)

3. Select a 3D view to publish with Reflect, either in the project browser or the default Revit 3D view.
