## Managing your storage in Reflect

The Unity Reflect Dashboard lets you manage where your projects are stored.

The **Projects** tab displays your projects in a list:

![Projects](images/1.4/DashboardProjects.png)

The list includes icons indicate where each project is currently stored: locally (<img src="images/1.3/Local.png" style="width: 25px;">), on a local network (<img src="images/1.3/Network.png" style="width: 25px;">), or in the cloud (<img src="images/1.3/Cloud.png" style="width: 25px;">).

## Cloud storage

Reflect gives you the option to host your projects in the cloud, letting you push data to your mobile devices even when you're on a different network.

**What data is sent to the cloud when doing an export?**

* If you export to a local or network server, no model data is sent over the internet.

* If you export to the cloud, then the input file is processed locally and derivative model data (geometry, materials, etc.) is sent to Unity.

* Project names are always sent over the internet to Unity.
