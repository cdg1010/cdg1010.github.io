# Changelog

## What's new in Unity Reflect 2.0?

This release sees the new Reflect App taken out of beta and made it widely available on all platforms. The addition of BIM 360 integration allows Reflect to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences.

### New plugin

* **BIM 360**: Users now have the ability to publish models from BIM 360. A link to the BIM 360 dashboard is available in the Viewer.

### Viewer improvements

* **Selection**: Selected objects are outlined rather than fully highlighted.
* **Help mode**
* **Project sorting**
* **Navigation cube**
* **Visual quality upgrades**
* **Expanded platform support**: New apps have been released for PC, OSX, iOS, and Android. We also support Oculus Rift and HTC Vive on PC and AR functionality on mobile platforms.


## Known issues

* Navisworks metadata in the Editor sometimes combines both imperial and metric measurements.
* Changing Revit elements while the live sync is active can sometimes cause issues with the blue preview boxes in the new beta viewer.
* Models with a very large coordinate range may not open in the correct place: sometimes, the model will be very far away and appear to not load. In this event, reduce the coordinate range and center the model. See [this forum post](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-reflect-navisworks-tips-and-tricks-moving-models-closer-to-the-origin.928281/#post-6287033) for details on the workaround.
