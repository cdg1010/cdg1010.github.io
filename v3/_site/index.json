These are blank templates with preloaded packages and settings that enable you to quickly create a Project. (For example: 2D, 3D, 3D with Extras.) For information about the current Core Templates, see [Core Templates]. LTS versions of Unity also offer: Sample Templates: Content-based templates designed to demonstrate Editor capabilities for a specific outcome. (For example: HDRP, Auto Showroom.) Learning Templates: Project-led templates designed to teach you to use Unity features or builds and to publish a Project for a specific outcome. (For example: FPS Microgame, 2D Platformer Microgame, Karting Microgame, LEGO® Microgame.) LTS Project Templates Because Templates are not shared between Editor versions, you need to download them separately for each version of the Editor you install. You must be connected to the Internet to see or download the latest Templates. Core Templates 2D Configures Project settings for 2D apps that use Unity’s built-in rendering pipeline . 3D Configures Project settings for 3D apps that use Unity’s built-in rendering pipeline . 3D with Extras Configures Project settings for 3D apps that use Unity’s built-in renderer and post-processing features . This Project type uses the new post-processing stack and includes several Presets to jump-start development along with example content. Sample Templates High Definition RP Available as a sample template from Editor version 2020.2.X onward, this template uses the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for graphics-intensive projects on platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11 and above). This project includes: Shader Graph: a tool that allows you to create shaders using a visual node editor instead of writing code. For more information on Shader Graph, see the Shader Graph documentation . Visual Effect Graph Presets Example content Universal Render Pipeline The Universal Render Pipeline Template configures Project settings for Projects where performance, wide platform support, and ease of customizing graphics are the primary considerations. This Template uses the following Unity features: Universal Render Pipeline (URP) : A prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline that is quick and easy to customize, and lets you create optimized graphics across a wide range of platforms. URP also includes an optimized 2D renderer complete with 2D lights and pixel perfect rendering, and an integrated post-processing solution. For more information on URP, see the URP documentation. Shader Graph : a tool that allows you to create shaders using a visual node editor instead of writing code. For more information on Shader Graph, see the Shader Graph documentation. The Template contains the following: A sample Scene that contains examples of how to configure lighting settings, Materials, Shaders, and post-processing effects in URP. Several preconfigured URP Assets that let you quickly swap between graphics quality levels. Presets optimized for use with URP.
