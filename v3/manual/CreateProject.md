# Create a project from a Template

To create a new Project and specify which Editor version to open it in, do one of the following:

* Click the **New** button. The title bar of the New Project dialog box displays the Editor version that the project will use.
* Click the **drop-down arrow** next to the New button to select the Editor version that you want to use.

> **Note:** This drop-down menu is only available if you previously installed multiple versions of the Editor in the Hub.

1. Choose a Project Template. For more information about Templates, see [Managing  your Templates](Templates.md).

  > **Note:** For information about a specific Template, click the information icon (ðŸ›ˆ).

2. Enter the name of your Project. This names the main Project folder, which stores the Assets, Scenes, and other files related to your Project.

3. Select where in your computerâ€™s filesystem to store your Project.

  By default, new Projects are stored in your computer's home folder. To store a Project elsewhere, type the file path to your preferred storage location in the Location field.

  You can also click the ellipsis icon (â€¦) to open your computerâ€™s file browser (Explorer, Finder or Files, depending on your computerâ€™s operating system), then navigate to the folder that you want to store your Project in and click **Select Folder** or **Open.**

4. When youâ€™re satisfied with the Project settings, click **Create.**
