# Downloading and installing with the Unity Hub

With the Unity Hub, you can download and launch different versions of the Unity Editor as well as optional modules.

## Installing the Unity Editor

1. Open the Unity Hub and click **Installs** in the left sidebar.

2. Click **Install Editor**.


The pop-up window displays the available Unity releases.
To download and install an official Unity release, select a version from the Official Releases tab.
To install pre-releases or archived versions of Unity, click Pre-Releases or Archive.
To install the Unity Editor from local files downloaded previously, click Install from Local Files in the lower right corner of the window.

Click Install.
If prompted, read and agree to the terms and conditions and then click Continue.

Select an install location and add any optional modules, then click Install.
Note: You can always add or remove modules later.


The Unity Hub can remove temporary installation files to free up disk space after installing the Editor. To enable this option, select Remove installation files automatically.
