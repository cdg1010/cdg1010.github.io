# System and network requirements

### System and network requirements
<!--
### **[Is this distinct from Unity Editor requirements? If so, I need this info.]**

Unity officially supports the following Linux distributions:

*   Ubuntu 16.04
*   Ubuntu 18.04
*   CentOS 7

**Note**: If Unity Hub fails to launch while you are using Linux, you might need to give UnityHub.AppImage executable permissions. To do this:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Go to the directory where UnityHub.AppImage is. This will be the Unity Hub directory.
3. Run chmod +x UnityHub.AppImage.
