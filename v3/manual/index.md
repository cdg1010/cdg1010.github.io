# Getting started with the Unity Hub

The Unity Hub is a standalone application that streamlines the way you find, download, and manage your Unity Projects and installations. In addition, you can manually add versions of the Editor that you have already installed on your machine to your Hub.

You can use the Hub to:

* Download and install the Unity Editor and modules.
* Manage downloads and multiple installations of Unity
* Create, manage, and launch Unity Projects.
* Explore templates, sample projects and more to learn and create in new ways.
* Manage your profile and preferences
* Get more resources about learning and using Unity
* Do Magic!

To get started, see [Installing the Hub](InstallHub.md).
